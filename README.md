## Problem Statement
It is easy to see and avoid a pothole while driving when the roads are dry. Imagine a scenario, its pouring and you have to go home by driving your car. The roads are flooded and you donâ€™t know where and how big the pothole is on the road. If there is an updated (updated on daily basis or in rain time twice a day) road map which shows you the potholes, there will be two advantages: first you may avoid your car getting stuck into it and second the corporation or the responsible authority can refer it for further action like maintaining the road etc. Uploading and updating the database of pothole on road on Maps to help people driving their vehicle when the roads are flooded.

## Our Solution
We are building a web application that will, with the help of user reports, update and maintain a database of potholes.With the help of Computer Vision we can detect and categorise the potholes on the basis of risk factor.We will also collect the geolocation of the user while reporting the pothole. With the help of a separate portal maintained by responsible authority,it can refer to it for further actions like maintaining the road.
